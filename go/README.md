# Go

Here is [Go](https://golang.org/).
This program was written with Go 1.13.4.

## Run

At the repository root:
```
cd go && go build
./go
```

/!\ This will move you into go/ folder. To go back to the previous folder do `cd -`.

## Notes

- Go does not have ternary operator : Go want to be a simple and easy-to-read language so it avoid multiple ways to do something.

- Go use type-inference : when a variable is defined with `:=` it takes the type and value of the element on the right.
