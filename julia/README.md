# Julia

Here is [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
This program was written with Julia 1.0.4.

## Run

At the repository root:
```
julia julia/pomodoro.jl
```

## Notes

- I created a main function because global variables (in this case count_run) can't be typed.

- The decision that each Integer will be Int64 is absolutely arbitrary (and I think Int8 or Int16 would be big enough).
