# Python

Here is [Python](https://www.python.org).
This program was written with Python 3.7.2 so you will need at least Python 3.

## Run

At the repository root:
```
python3 python/pomodoro.py
```

## Notes

- In display_time function I used a ternary operation for 'minutes' and 'seconds' variables with this form: (if_condition_is_false, if_condition_is_true)[condition].
