## Notes

- The `sub` keywork create a subroutine / function. Using `$_[0]` you get the first argument given to the subroutine.

- Perl makes no difference between integer or string variables. When needed Perl converts the variables to the wanted type.

- The `my` keyword is a scope keyword : it create a private, non-global variable. The `our` keyword create a public, global variable.
