# Ruby

Here is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
This program was written with Ruby 2.5.7.

## Run

```
ruby ruby/pomodoro.rb
```

## Notes

- Ruby is a strongly-typed language : you can't define the type of a variable (like int x) but the type is given by the first value you give to the variable. That's why, even if I don't define the type of the variable x, in the display_time function x / 60 is always an integer (int / int = int).
