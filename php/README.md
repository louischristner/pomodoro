# PHP

Here is [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
This program was written with PHP 7.3.11.

## Run

At the repository root:
```
php php/pomodoro.php
```

## Notes

- In PHP 7.3.11 you can't specify the type of a variable (like int $x for example) except in function arguments. This will apparently be implemented in [PHP 7.4](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2).
